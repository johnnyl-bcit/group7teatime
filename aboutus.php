				<h1>About Our Tea</h1>
				<h3>Black Tea</h3>
				<p>Black tea is harvested from the Assamese plant. Its black colour comes from the over-oxidization of tea-leaves, either through the process of smoking them or by the sun, allowing them to retain their flavour for several years. The perks of being over-oxidized are that it lets them gain a stronger, multi-complex flavour profile in comparison to the other types. Black Tea is recommended for anyone looking for a tea with a medium to high amount of caffeine.</p>

				<h3>Green Tea</h3>
				<p>Green tea leaves are harvested from Camellia sinensis plant, where they are immediately steamed and dried. Immediately steaming the leaves gives green tea a mild taste making it more natural and organic. Consumption of green tea has been associated with many different types of health benefits ranging from increased metabolic rate to reduced risks to cardiovascular diseases. Green tea is recommended for anyone looking for a tea with a low to medium amount of caffeine amount.</p>

				<h3>Oolong Tea</h3>
				<p>Oolong Tea is also harvested from Camellia sinensis leaves but have been withered by sunlight and only partially oxidized. As a result of this process, it has a wide flavour profile ranging from a fragrant-fruity to a bolder, robust taste. Oolong Tea is recommended for anyone looking for a tea with a low to high amount of caffeine.</p>

				<h3>White Tea</h3>
				<p>White tea contains the most amount of antioxidants out of all the tea groups. Similar to both the oolong tea and green tea, white tea is harvested from the Camellia sinensis plant, which allows it to have the same benefits as the others. It is harvested when the tea leaves are young and quickly dried giving it a distinct sweet and fragrant taste. White tea is recommended for anyone looking for a tea with a lower caffeine amount.</p>

				<h3>Pu-Erh Tea</h3>
				<p>Pu-Erh tea is a form of black tea that has undergone a different cultivation process of being both aged and fermented. The moment the leaves are picked they are quickly processed in order to stop oxidation. Due to the fermentation process Pu-Erh has flavour profile of fruity with an earthy undertone.  Pu-Erh tea is recommended for anyone looking for a tea with a medium to high amount of caffeine.</p>
